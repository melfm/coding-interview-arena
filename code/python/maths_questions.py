    Instead consider prime factors, a trailing zero is produced by 2
    and 5. It turns out the number of 2s in prime factors is always
    more than or equal to the number of 5s, so we just need to count 5s.
    Finally, we also need to consider numbers like 25, 125 etc that have
    more than one 5 (consider 28!). To handle this, we start by dividing
    by 5, and then multiples of 5, like 25 and so on.
